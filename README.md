### Introduction

It was my first goal to implement a chat-bot when i decided to study for cs. And i just finished the project as soon as i got into a group called 'SSAFY'.

I learned how to program the logics and utilize API. After all, I was able to connect all together with my server.

Just got wondered at that point. What would I be able to do with those skills? Therefore, I started build up my own '**kor2eng and eng2kor translation chat-bot**'. 

With my instruction, it will be pretty easy for everyone. I hope it would be very helpful for anyone who wants to implement your own cutie-pie. ;-)

Let me know if you have better ideas or additions. Always welcome to have other opinions!
